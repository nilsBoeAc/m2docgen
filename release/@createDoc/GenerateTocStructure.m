function GenerateTocStructure(obj)
%% Description:
%   This function assignes each file a table of contents path. For Example,
%   if a file can be found unter /MyToolbox/Vehicles/Air/plane.m and the
%   obj.toc is structured like "/MyToolbox/Aircraft", then each file in
%   the Vehicles/Air/-subfolder will be assigned the toc path 
%   "/MyToolbox/Aircraft". This works by (ONLY) checking the last folder of
%   the current .m file and cross-referencing it by revursively going
%   through the obj.toc structure, finding the last folder and writing the
%   current toc path to the file list.
%
%% Syntax:
%   obj.GenerateTocStructure
%
%% Input:
%   no direct inputs
%       gets obj.fileList
%
%% Output:
%   no direct outputs
%       saves obj.fileList

% checked if the current element is present. If not, it is added. If the
% cellPath contains more folders, than the cell associated with the
% found/added current element is used to call this function again. Cellpath
% is reduced by its leftest/first element.
% custom rule: Folders without a custom toc definition will be added to
% tocCell{1,1]. Subfolders of that folder will remain in that path.
